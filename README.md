# R-Shiny-App
Hello! Welcome to my R Shiny app I made for my SPH BS 803 (Statistical Programming for Biostatisticians) class. After uploading the [diamonds.txt file](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/BS-803-R-Shiny-App/blob/main/diamonds.txt), which contains information on almost 54,000 diamonds, this R Shiny app creates a histogram of the carat variable. Use the slider to subset how many diamonds to include in the histogram.
